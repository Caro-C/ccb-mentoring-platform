              <div class="single-short-text">CoffeeCodeBreak is a tech blog for (still) non-techies. The world of software development has long been quite overwhelming and uninviting to me. I was lucky to enter this world - more or less intentionally - through my first job. Since then, I have been learning every day anew how exciting software development is. I have learned how much creative potential it has and how much freedom of life it can offer. With this blog I would like to share with you what I would have liked to have discovered myself much earlier. And maybe I can even motivate you to try it as well.</div>
              <div class="single-post-text">

                    Welcome to my blog CoffeeCodeBreak!<br><br>

                    I am happy that you are here and I hope you will take a little bit of inspiration and new knowledge with you.<br><br>

                    I am Caro and I have been working in IT projects for about three years - first as a consultant, then as a product manager. I have designed software, coordinated project teams and managed development. But what has always had a touch of magic for me was the actual creation of the software. Maybe it's the same for you.<br><br>

                    Since the beginning I have admired my development teams for transforming concepts into a visual product through code. The longer I watched them do it, the more I wished I could do it myself. I realized what creativity and independence these skills can unleash. Finally I decided to take three months off to teach myself how to develop. This blog is my first project and I am fascinated daily by how pure code turns into something visible. Something which is exactly looking like what I had in mind.<br><br>

                    Until a few years ago, this world was completely foreign to me. I studied industrial engineering and my computer science lectures taught me everything else than how software is built in the real world. I would have been very grateful if a friend of mine had told me back then how much fun it can be to develop software yourself. Or if I had had something appealing with which I could have sat down comfortably in a caf√© and read in. Something that would have familiarized me with this world and inspired me to dive deeper into it. I believe that many more women in particular would have access to software and digital product development if this world were less cryptic and edgy.<br><br>

                    On my way I have found that sometimes the biggest challenge can be to gain a basic understanding. There are countless great sources and answers on the Internet - but most of them can only be understood if you already know the context.<br>
                    CoffeeCodeBreak is my invitation to you to approach these topics. I would like to support you in achieving this basic understanding and to be able to speak with confidence. Many of the often seemingly dry facts are in reality much more vivid than expected.
                    Creating digital products is certainly a challenge, but definitely not magic.<br><br>

                    Maybe you are just curious about what's behind websites and other digital products. Maybe you would like to read again in compact form what you already know. Maybe you need a quick overview for your current project in your job.<br>
                    No matter for what reason you came across my blog - I want to share with you all the exciting things I've learned in small posts in an understandable and simple way.<br>
                    And maybe I can even motivate you with my enthusiasm and give you the confidence to try it out as well. I'm sure you can! <br><br>

                    Under "TECH-READS" you will find contributions to technical questions that I have either asked myself or that have been asked. The level shows you how advanced the topic of the respective blog post is.<br>
                    At "INSPIRATION" I put together what has helped me on my way so far, what motivates and inspires me. Furthermore I would like to introduce you to other girls and women who have decided to become software developers.<br>
                    And finally, under "CAREER" I share with you everything that concerns me around female careers in the tech industry.<br><br>

                    You are always welcome to give me feedback or suggestions. I am happy about ideas and new questions, which I can answer. Enjoy reading!<br><br>

                    Caro
