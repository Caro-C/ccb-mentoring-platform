                  CoffeeCodeBreak lives from a <strong>respectful and fair way of networking.</strong><br> Our goal is to support each other through <strong>high-quality mentoring</strong> and by building up an <strong>inspiriring network</strong>.
                  And we can only succeed if each of us makes her own contribution.<br> Therefore please consider the following points:<br>
                  <ul class="booking-list" style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>If you are not able to attend your mentoring session after all, <strong>please cancel it in time.</strong><br>
                    <li>Please remember that our network grows most sustainably when other women also have enough opportunities for mentoring. Therefore <strong>act to the best of your knowledge and belief regarding the number of your sessions.</strong><br>
                    <li>Our mentors spend their time with you because they would like to share their experience with you, give something back and learn from you. So use the time for a good conversation. CoffeeCodeBreak is explicitly <strong>not meant for spreading your own commercial or ideological interests.</strong>
                  </ul>
