                You don't know where to start? I feel you!
                The good news is: there are really good ways to learn programming from scratch.
                With this blog post I want to help you to find a good start.
                I will show you ways to get started and tell you what worked out great for myself.
              </div>
              <div class="single-post-text">
                First of all: Congratulations! I am happy about your curiosity and about the fact that you want to learn programming! <br><br>

                From my own experience I know that this is usually not an obvious decision. Probably there was some kind of trigger that made you curious.

                In my dream world these triggers wouldn't even have to exist. It would be natural to learn the basics of software development already at school. In an easy and understandable way. It would be natural that we include these topics in our choice of studies or job just as much as those from biology, arts or math.<br><br>

                Unfortunately, this is still my dream world and therefore I am even more happy about your trigger! The good thing about it is that you have actively decided to learn it yourself. And of course this makes you much more motivated.
                Since motivation is one of the most important things if you want to learn programming, you are already on the right track! :)<br><br>

                <h2 class="h2-for-post">What's your goal?</h2>

                In my opinion, it's essential to think about your actual goal. Because without a goal, motivation usually leaves you quite quickly. If you know your goal, you can also decide much better how much time and money you want to invest in learning programming.

                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>Maybe you haven't had anything to do with programming yet and would just like to take a look. This is also a goal and the first step to possibly discover that you want to learn more. So if you just want to try out a little bit, you probably won't be able or willing to spend that much time. You will probably also be less willing to spend money on programming courses etc.<br><br>
                <li>Maybe you have already come into contact with software development or code and decided to learn programming seriously. This works best if you have a project in mind where you can apply your new skills directly. Then your goal is something like your guarantee for curiosity and the necessary perseverance to succeed. And probably you are also willing to spend more time and maybe money to reach your goal.<br><br>
                </ul>
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The best way to start depends on your goal. And, of course, it makes sense to get a feel for programming before you start to really work towards a job. In either case, let's just look at how to get started and how to get closer to your goal.<br><br>

                <h2 class="h2-for-post">How to get started, if I never had anything to do with software before?</h2>

                <h4>1. Don't get discouraged by all the information out there</h4>

                The world of software development can seem pretty overwhelming. All these terms and programming languages and the countless sources on the internet, which often seem like single, unconnected snippets... If you feel overwhelmed, I can absolutely understand. I've felt that way for a long time.<br><br>

                The good thing is: once you have shed some light on the dark and got a rough overview, it's not so confusing anymore. Then the individual terms, programming languages and technologies can be put into a big picture quite easily.<br><br>

                Now you're probably asking yourself, 'Okay, but how do I bring light into the darkness?' In my opinion, one of the best ways is a good online course. But more on that later. First, I'd like to give you some basic information that might help you get a general idea of what you're looking for.

                <h5>Frontend and Backend</h5>

                If you want to develop software/web applications, there are basically two directions or 'layers': the frontend and the backend.<br><br>

                The frontend is everything you see as a user. Imagine you are on LinkedIn. Everything you can see here - your newsfeed, profile, inbox, etc. is part of the frontend.<br><br>

                Now you can create a profile on LinkedIn where your user data is stored. You can also interact with other users, leave messages, post messages and much more. Everything you leave on LinkedIn has to be stored and processed somehow. For example, information needs to be stored in a database and retrieved when you or another user accesses it. And this is exactly what happens in the backend. That's not all a backend can do, of course. Often complex, logical operations and calculations have to be made. Google Maps, for example, must somehow calculate your route, its duration and so on, if you want to get from A to B.

                <h5>Frontend programming</h5>

                To program a frontend or a backend you need different languages. For a frontend you basically need HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br><br>

                HTML and CSS are not real programming languages.<br>
                <strong>HTML</strong> is a so-called markup language and in my opinion a good starting point. Markup languages are languages where you can 'mark up' text elements and assign certain properties to them.<br><br>
                <strong>CSS</strong> is a stylesheet language used to design the HTML elements. They are both quite simple, you slowly get familiar with code and get a visual result immediately. So with HTML you write the content of your frontend and with CSS you design it visually.<br><br>

                <strong>JavaScript</strong> on the other hand is a real programming language and very widespread. If you want to know more about it, you can find a <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology" target="_blank" class="blog-links">survey about popular programming languages</a> on Stack Overflow. With JavaScript you can make your frontend interactive. You access the individual elements and determine what happens when a user clicks on them, for example.

                <h5>Backend programming</h5>

                There are several different programming languages for the backend and each developer will probably recommend his personal favorite language. Popular backend languages to start with are for example Python or Ruby. These two are quite clear and intuitive. Experienced developers have told me that it is not so important which of the popular languages you choose, but that you really understand and master them. Once you have done that, it is quite easy to switch to one of the other languages. They are all quite similar in structure.

                <h5>Frameworks</h5>

                If you stumble upon terms like React, Vue, Angular, Django or Rales, these are not programming languages, by the way. They are so-called frameworks. These are collections of programs that you can use to write your code more efficiently. They offer you ready-made solution modules for certain problems that you would otherwise have to program yourself from scratch.<br><br>

                Of course you can not only program web applications, but also mobile apps, computer games etc. For this you need other languages and technologies. For iOS apps, for example, you have to learn Swift. But you have to start somewhere and get access to the whole thing. And HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a classic backend language are really well suited for that.<br><br>

                <h4>2. Find a suitable online course</h4>

                Of course there are many books for the introduction to programming. Basically, looking up, researching and reading is essential for the survival of every developer. However, I am convinced that you will find it easier to get started if you (also) choose a suitable online course. Online courses are more interactive than books, more 'natural' and therefore more understandable and motivating. In addition, you are always at the computer and can apply what you have learned directly.<br><br>

                Meanwhile there are some really good platforms offering programming courses for all experience levels. In a good beginners course, the tutors introduce you to programming step by step. Above all, you will learn why the code is written this way and what happens in the background. <br><br>

                As I mentioned above, HTML, CSS and JavaScript are in my opinion very well suited to get familiar with code and software development. Furthermore I don't think it's wrong to learn the basics of a backend language as well. This helps you once again to understand how programming languages work and how your computer processes programs. It also gives you the opportunity to find out if you enjoy frontend or backend programming more, if you want to go deeper.<br><br>

                I can only recommend that you start with a mixture of basic courses covering these topics. There are some courses that directly cover a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Or courses that also include a backend language as a general introduction to programming. Be sure to pay attention to the quality! A badly done introductory course can, in the worst case, spoil your interest in programming and that would be a pity!<br><br>

                In the following sections I will introduce you to three platforms for online courses that I have tried out myself.

                <h5>Udacity</h5>

                From my personal experience I can highly recommend <a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">Udacity</a>.
                On Udacity you will find free courses in addition to the paid (and not so cheap) ones (Nanodegrees).
                The free courses are much shorter, but there is no difference in quality. Frequently, sub-modules of the paid courses even consist of the free ones. One of the main differences, apart from the scope, is that there are no mandatory projects for the free courses. In addition, you won't receive a certificate.<br><br>

                A good, free basic course for HTML and CSS would be for example this one: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001" target="_blank" class="blog-links">Intro to HTML and CSS</a>. <br>
                Each course on Udacity has a level and there are multiple courses with the level 'Beginner' available.<br><br>

                I really like the format because you can see the instructors in the videos and hear their voices. This feels more personal to me than a course where mainly text and exercises are shown. But that is certainly a matter of taste. Besides the videos, the courses also include written explanations, exercises and quizzes.

                <h5>Codecademy</h5>

                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">Codecademy</a> offers a huge selection of courses on all topics that are currently popular in the field of software development. The courses I tested were really good in quality.<br><br>

                On Codecademy you can also find free and paid courses. You don't buy the paid courses separately, but get a pro subscription for currently 18€ per month. With this subscription you can access all paid courses. This is comparatively cheap and might be an option for you if you just want to try out a little bit and want to have a wider choice.<br><br>

                The concept is slightly different from Udacity's. At Codecademy you will receive written learning material and exercises during the courses. You can then try out and validate the exercises directly in an online editor. (You will find a little explanation about editors in my blog post <a href="../reads-en/how-to-build-a-website.html" class="blog-links">How I built this blog</a>) After attending some Udacity courses I missed a little bit the personal relationship to the instructor. That always gave me additional motivation. But as I said, that is a matter of taste.

                <h5>Udemy</h5>

                Besides Udacity and Codecademy I have tried <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">Udemy</a>. Udemy offers all kinds of courses that go far beyond programming and software development.<br><br>

                The courses on Udemy are fee-based, but there are always special offers where you can get them very cheap (often for only 10-20€ per course). Be a bit careful about the quality here. I have already found both good and not so good courses on Udemy. Check out the ratings and preview videos. There are also  courses that are not really up to date anymore.<br><br>

                Because of the large selection you can find quite good basic courses though. By the way, if you don't like a course, there is a 30-day money-back guarantee. I've already used it and it worked without any problems.

                <h5>Further platforms</h5>

                If you do some research, you will find many more platforms. For example <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">Freecodecamp</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">Coursera</a> or <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">Treehouse</a>. Unfortunately I have no personal experience with these so far. But you will surely find enough information online. Also feel free to share your experiences or further recommendations in the comments!

                <h5>Online Games</h5>

                By the way, if you are someone who prefers to learn through play, there are a number of online games to learn coding. Of course, a game doesn't replace a whole course. But it can help you to get a feeling for code or to strengthen your skills. You can find some ideas in the following article from Skillcrush: <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/free-coding-games/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">15 free coding games to improve and level up your coding skills</a><br>
                If you are interested in iPhone apps: Apple offers the free App <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">Swift Playgrounds</a> on which you can learn Swift in a playful way.<br><br>

                <h4>3. Practice as much as possible!</h4>

                The most important thing when learning programming is that you do it yourself. That's the only way to really strengthen your new skills. Of course, you can only listen to pure theory if you just want to know what's roughly behind it. But believe me, it's much more fun when you try it out yourself.<br><br>

                If you write code yourself, you will regularly have small success stories. You also become curious and creative. You start googling for solutions beyond your courses if you get stuck or want to try something. And so you become more and more confident in the basics and develop further without even noticing it yourself.<br><br>

                Many online courses offer you small exercises that you can implement directly on the platform in their editor. I think the idea itself is not bad. However, I have always preferred to use my own editor because it just felt more 'real'. If your course suggests that you install an editor, make sure you do so. Usually the instructors will guide you through the installation and show you the basic functions of the editor. If this is not the case, you will find enough tutorials on YouTube explaining how to install and use an editor. Popular editors are for example Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad++, Bluefish or Brackets.<br><br>

                So if you want to learn more, practice as much as you can! Maybe you have a little project in mind that you would like to realize. For example a personal website? My blog was created that way and that was the best thing I could have done. Building the blog was my step away from online courses and pure imitation to finding solutions on my own. The online courses taught me the basics without which I could not have started. But I learned most of what I learned on my own website.<br><br>

                In my blog post <a href="../reads-en/how-to-build-a-website.html" class="blog-links">How I built this blog</a> you can find a small summary about how I built this website.<br><br>

                <h4>4. Extend your knowledge with further sources</h4>

                Without the numerous sources on the internet I would have been absolutely lost. As soon as you start to implement your own little project, you will always get stuck. Especially at the beginning. Don't let this discourage you in any way! I often spent hours looking for the solution to a problem. And the more this happened, the more relaxed and patient I became with it. Because I knew that I would definitely find the solution somewhere.<br><br>

                Someone - especially while you're still at the beginning - certainly has had the same problem before. I've noticed that the developer community is something pretty special. It's just incredibly helpful. It feels like developers share their knowledge everywhere. Once you start googling, you'll find countless sources of help. Of course, you have to learn to look for solutions the 'right way'. That means using the right terms for your problem. But little by little you will learn this by yourself. Therefore, it may take a little longer in the beginning until you find the solution.<br><br>

                <u><strong>Here is a small overview of possible sources:</strong></u><br>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                  <li><strong>MDN</strong>: whenever I have a basic understanding question about HTML, CSS or JavaScript, I have a look at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/MDN" target="_blank" class="blog-links">MDN Web Documentation</a> of Mozilla. MDN is a Wiki where you can look up really everything about the basics.<br><br>
                    <li><strong>w3schools</strong>: another really comprehensive source which I use very often is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">w3schools</a>. Here you can also find everything about HTML, CSS, JavaScript (but also SQL, Python etc.) The explanations contain super helpful code examples that you can try out directly on the site.<br><br>
                  <li><strong>Google</strong>: if you have a concrete problem that goes beyond basic understanding, google for it! Mostly you will find the answer:
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" class="blog-links"><strong>Stack Overflow</strong></a>, a huge developer online community
                    <li>in other <strong>developer forums</strong>
                    <li>on <strong>developer blogs</strong> (a very well known and recommended CSS blog is for example <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">css-tricks</a> by Greg Wolanski)
                  </ul><br>
                  <li><strong>YouTube</strong>. For topics that are not too specific, there are often super helpful videos on YouTube.<br><br>
                  <li><strong>Your personal network</strong>. If you know developers, you will be amazed at how much most of them enjoy supporting and helping you!<br>

                <h4>5. Don't give up!</h4>

                If you feel like enjoying programming, don't give up if you get stuck. It can be really frustrating not knowing what to do. But, like I said, you will find support and a solution for everything if you look for it. And next time you know how to do it yourself. The learning curve is incredibly steep. You'll be amazed at how quickly you make progress.<br><br>

                When I started building this blog, I couldn't write two lines of code myself without looking. And after only a week, the blog was suddenly ready to look like a decent website. What surprised me the most was that I was suddenly able to write at least my HTML and CSS code freely. I only had to check if I wanted to add something I hadn't done before.<br><br>

                To come back to the topic of 'setting a goal': I am sure that it worked so well because I wanted to reach my goal. In my case, my goal was initially to learn to develop well enough so that I could apply for a job. And while I was working on this goal, another goal stepped into my head with my website.<br><br>

                I had clung to every detail until it was implemented. And in between I got stuck more than once. But after the first hurdles I realized that it is only a matter of time until you find the solution and getting stuck is just part of it. Actually, it's even great to get stuck! The deeper you get stuck, the greater the learning effect when you have solved the problem. And the reward is always that priceless feeling of having created something new yourself! :)<br><br>

                <h2 class="h2-for-post">How do I start if I really want to become a developer?</h2>

                If you really want to become a developer, basically the same things apply as I've already told you in the last sections. The difference is that you probably already had one or the other point of contact with software. You probably already have a sense of whether you want to move towards frontend or backend development. Furthermore, you are probably willing to invest more time and possibly money.<br><br>

                From my point of view, it's worth it. For example, I had taken three months to focus exclusively on learning to program. Of course, I couldn't know beforehand whether I would actually enjoy it so much that I would end up working as a developer. But I was firmly convinced that I had nothing to lose. After all, programming skills would only have made me a better product manager or IT consultant in the worst case.
                So it's best to think about how high the actual risk for you is and whether you can or want to take it.<br><br>

                If you decide to learn programming full-time, there are other, more 'holistic' options besides the smaller online courses and other materials.<br><br>

                <h4>Bootcamps</h4>

                A very popular option are programming bootcamps. A very good friend of mine did that. She did a 9-week, fairly intensive bootcamp and then joined a startup as a software developer.<br><br>

                The advantage of these bootcamps is that you don't learn programming alone. You have the other students around you who are in the same situation. So you build up a network directly and stay motivated with a higher probability. You work together on projects and have teachers you can always ask for help. In addition, there are often company cooperations that increase your chances of finding a job quickly, even as a junior.<br><br>

                Unfortunately these bootcamps are quite expensive. Some of the better known bootcamps are Le Wagon, Ironhack, Codeworks, Wild Code School or Spiced Academy. The costs are rather in the upper four-digit range. Under 6000€ you can hardly get away. In certain cases there are scholarships or governmental support. If you don't live in the city where the bootcamp takes place, consider that cost of living will be added to the price as well.<br><br>

                If you google for it, you will find all sorts of opinions on whether a boot camp is worthwhile or not. I guess it all depends on how you learn best and what fits best with your life situation.<br><br>

                <h4>My choice: Udacity Nanodegree</h4>

                I had decided against going with a programming bootcamp. On the one hand, I found a bootcamp very expensive and wondered if it was worth it for me. On the other hand, I had unintendedly managed to quit my job just when Corona started. This meant that the bootcamps only took place online anyway. Since I knew that Udacity offers very extensive Nanodegrees, I had decided to give it a try.

                <h5>Costs</h5>
                I had decided to start with the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000" target="_blank" class="blog-links">Introduction to Programming Nanodegree</a>. The course is designed for 4 months at 5-10 hours per week. For 4 months you pay between 1000€ and 1500€. But you can also buy it on a monthly basis for 300-400€. I was quite lucky, because Udacity had temporarily provided all Nanodegrees for one month free of charge because of Corona. And one month was more than enough time for me - since I did the course full-time. Most of the time, Udacity also offers quite high discounts on the courses and you rarely have to pay the full price. Compared to a bootcamp, I think at least the monthly prices for a course are really justified.

                <h5>Content</h5>
                The Intro to Programming course covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python Basics. I found this mixture really useful. I already knew that I would like to dive deeper into the frontend. However, it was a good opportunity to validate this once again. The course was structured in a nice and transparent way, there were many exercises and three small mandatory projects. And the instructors put a lot of effort into covering the basics really thoroughly. That helped me a lot to become more independent step by step and to be confident that I could build a website myself.

                <h5>My further steps</h5>
                I must admit that my Industrial Engineering degree and my professional experience helped me to quickly understand the subject matter. Maybe it takes a little longer to understand basic concepts such as loops if you have never seen any before. But I'm sure that you will be able to cope with the course even without any previous knowledge if you stay focused.<br><br>

                After the intro course, I took further courses to deepen my knowledge. These courses were then specifically tailored to frontend development. The intro course had covered the basics thoroughly - which was absolutely necessary - but still they were just basics. At the same time I started to build my blog. The combination of courses, a lot of research and my own project made me feel ready to apply for entry level positions after a few weeks. In my case, it worked out really well and I guess I wouldn't have had more from a boot camp.<br><br>

                <h4>Further options</h4>

                A bootcamp or a Udacity Nanodegree are of course not the only ways to become a developer. They are two ways, which have proven to be both very effective for my friend and me. But I also know many developers who have taught themselves programming through many smaller online courses, reading code and documentation etc.<br><br>

                The main thing is that you get started. That you just get active, make a plan, don't get discouraged and stay curious. I know how intimidating all those great sources and the vast knowledge of other developers can be. But don't let them unsettle you and use them for yourself as best as you can! Even the most experienced developers have started at some point. And I really rarely got more support!<br><br>

                I hope I could help you a little bit and gave you some confidence to get started!<br><br>

                See you soon!<br><br>

                Caro
