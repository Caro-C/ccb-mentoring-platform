                <p>In accordance with the statutory provisions of data protection law (in particular the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) as amended and the European basic data protection regulation 'DS-GVO'), we would like to inform you about the type, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data. This privacy policy also applies to our websites and social media profiles. With regard to the definition of terms such as "personal data" or "processing", we refer to Art. 4 DS-GVO.</p>
                <strong>Name and contact details of the person responsible</strong><br />
                Our responsible person (hereinafter "responsible person") within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 7 DS-GVO is:<br /><br>Carolyn Covic<br>Prinzregentenstrasse 151<br>81677 Munich<br>+49 162 2373407
                <br />
                <br />

                <strong>Data types, purposes of processing and categories of data subjects</strong><br />
                <p>In the following, we inform you about the type, scope and purpose of collecting, processing and using personal data.</p>
                <strong>1. Types of data we process</strong><br />
                Usage data (access times, websites visited etc.), contact data (telephone number, e-mail, fax etc.),<br />
                <br />
                <strong>2. Purposes of processing under Article 13 (1) c) of the DS-GVO</strong><br />
                Optimize website technically and economically, provide easy access to the website, optimize and statistically evaluate our services, improve user experience, make website user-friendly, create statistics, handle contact requests, provide websites with functions and content, <br />
                <br />
                <strong>3. Categories of persons concerned under Article 13(1)(e) of the DS-GVO</strong><br />
                Visitors/users of the website, <br />
                <br />
                <p>The persons concerned are collectively referred to as "users".</p>
                <br />

                <strong>Legal basis for the processing of personal data</strong>
                <p>In the following we inform you about the legal basis of the processing of personal data:</p>
                <ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">
                <li>If we have obtained your consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) DS-GVO is the legal basis.</li>
                <li>If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in response to your request, Article 6 (1) sentence 1 letter b) DS-GVO is the legal basis.</li>
                <li>If the processing is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g. statutory storage obligations), Art. 6 Para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c) DS-GVO is the legal basis.</li>
                <li>If the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, the legal basis is Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. d) DS-GVO.</li>
                <li>If the processing is necessary to safeguard our interests or the legitimate interests of a third party and your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms do not prevail in this respect, Article 6 (1) sentence 1 letter f) of the DS-GVO is the legal basis.</li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                <strong>Transfer of personal data to third parties and processors</strong>
                <p>Without your consent, we will not pass on any data to third parties. Should this be the case, however, the transfer will be made on the basis of the aforementioned legal bases, e.g. when data is passed on to online payment providers for the purpose of fulfilling a contract or due to a court order or due to a legal obligation to surrender the data for the purpose of criminal prosecution, to avert danger or to enforce intellectual property rights.<br />
                We also use contract processors (external service providers e.g. for web hosting of our websites and databases) to process your data. If data is passed on to the processors as part of an agreement for order processing, this is always done in accordance with Art. 28 DS-GVO. We select our processors carefully, check them regularly and have been granted the right to issue instructions regarding the data. In addition, the processors must have taken suitable technical and organisational measures and comply with the data protection regulations according to BDSG n.F. and DS-GVO</p>

                <br />
                <strong>Transfer of data to third countries</strong>
                <p>The adoption of the European Data Protection Basic Regulation (DS-GVO) has created a uniform basis for data protection in Europe. Your data is therefore processed primarily by companies to which the DS-GVO applies. If, however, processing is carried out by services of third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, they must comply with the special requirements of Art. 44 ff. DS-GVO. This means that the processing is carried out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the EU Commission's officially recognised determination of a level of data protection corresponding to that of the EU or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations, the so-called "standard contractual clauses". In the case of US companies, submission to the so-called "privacy shield", the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, fulfils these requirements.</p>

                <br />
                <strong>Erasure of data and storage duration</strong>
                <p>Unless expressly stated in this data protection declaration, your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the consent granted for processing is revoked by you or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies or the data is no longer required for the purpose, unless its further storage is required for evidence purposes or this is opposed by statutory storage obligations. This includes, for example, commercial storage obligations for business letters according to § 257 para. 1 HGB (6 years) as well as tax storage obligations according to § 147 para. 1 AO of receipts (10 years). When the prescribed retention period expires, your data will be blocked or deleted, unless the storage is still necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.</p>

                <br/>
                <strong>Existence of automated decision making</strong>
                <p>We do not use automatic decision making or profiling.</p>

                <br/>
                <strong>Provision of our website and creation of log files</strong>
                <ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">

                <li>The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest in data processing in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S.1 lit. f) DS-GVO, which also lies in the above-mentioned purposes.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>For security reasons, we store this data in server log files for the storage period of 30 days. After this period has elapsed, they are automatically deleted, unless we need to keep them for evidence in the event of attacks on the server infrastructure or other legal violations.<br /></li>

                <strong>Cookies</strong>
                <ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">
                <li>We use so-called cookies when you visit our website. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser places and saves on your computer. When you visit our website again, these cookies provide information to automatically recognize you. Cookies also include the so-called "user IDs", where user information is stored using pseudonymised profiles. When you call up our website, we will inform you about the use of cookies for the aforementioned purposes and how you can allow or object to them or prevent their storage ("opt-in") by referring to our data protection declaration.<br /><br />
                <li>The following cookie types are distinguished:</strong><br /><br />
                <Strong>- Necessary, essential cookies:</strong> Essential cookies are cookies that are absolutely necessary for the operation of the website, in order to save certain functions of the website such as logins, shopping cart or user entries, e.g. regarding the language of the website.<br /><br />
                <strong>- Session-Cookies:</strong> Session-Cookies are needed to recognize multiple use of an offer by the same user (e.g. if you have logged in to determine your login status). When you visit our site again, these cookies provide information to automatically recognize you. The information obtained in this way is used to optimise our offers and make it easier for you to access our site. When you close the browser or log out, the session cookies are deleted.<br /><br />
                <strong>- Persistent Cookies:</strong> These cookies remain stored even after closing the browser. They are used to save the login, to measure the reach and for marketing purposes. They are automatically deleted after a preset period of time, which can vary depending on the cookie. You can delete the cookies at any time in the security settings of your browser.<br /><br />
                <strong>- Third party cookies (especially from advertisers):</strong> According to your wishes, you can configure your browser settings and, for example, refuse to accept third party cookies or all cookies. However, we would like to point out at this point that you may then not be able to use all functions of this website. Please read more about these cookies in the respective data protection declarations of the third-party providers.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li><strong>data categories:</strong> user data, cookie, user ID (including the pages visited, device information, access times and IP addresses).<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>purposes of processing:</strong> The information obtained in this way serves the purpose of optimising our web offers technically and economically and to enable you to access our website more easily and securely.<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> If we process your personal data with the aid of cookies on the basis of your consent ("opt-in"), then Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a) DSGVO is the legal basis. Otherwise we have a legitimate interest in the effective functionality, improvement and economic operation of the website, so that in this case Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) DS-GVO is the legal basis. In addition, the legal basis is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 S. 1 lit. b) DS-GVO, if the cookies are used to initiate a contract, e.g. when orders are placed.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for the purpose for which they were collected. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.<br /><br />Cookies are otherwise stored on your computer and transmitted by it to our site. Therefore, you as a user also have full control over the use of cookies. By changing the settings in your Internet browser, you can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies. Cookies already stored can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it may no longer be possible to use all functions of the website to their full extent.<br /><br />

                <li>When you contact us by contact form, fax, post or e-mail, your data will be processed for the purpose of handling your contact request.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>The legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 S. 1 lit. a) DS-GVO, provided you have given your consent. The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of a contact enquiry or e-mail, letter or fax is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 S. 1 lit. f) DS-GVO. The person responsible has a legitimate interest in the processing and storage of the data in order to be able to respond to user enquiries, to secure evidence on liability grounds and, where appropriate, to be able to comply with his or her statutory obligations to retain business letters. If the contact is aimed at the conclusion of a contract, an additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 S. 1 lit. b) DS-GVO.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>We may store your details and contact request in our customer relationship management system ("CRM system") or a comparable system.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for the purpose of their collection. For the personal data from the input mask of the contact form and those sent by e-mail, this is the case when the respective conversation with you has ended. The conversation is finished when it can be concluded from the circumstances that the matter in question has been finally clarified. Inquiries from users who have an account or a contract with us will be stored for a period of two years after termination of the contract. In the case of legal archiving obligations, the deletion takes place after their expiry: End of commercial (6 years) and tax (10 years) storage obligation.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>You have the possibility at any time to revoke your consent under Art. 6 Paragraph 1 S. 1 lit. a) DS-GVO to the processing of personal data. If you contact us by e-mail, you can object to the storage of your personal data at any time.<br /><br /></li>

When you visit our website, Google places a cookie on your computer in order to be able to analyse your use of our website. We have activated IP anonymisation, which means that IP addresses are only processed in a shortened form. On this website, your IP address will therefore be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states which are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services to the responsible person in connection with the use of the website and the Internet. In addition, we have also activated an extensive analysis of website visitors, which is carried out via a so-called user ID. The IP address transmitted by your browser within the framework of Google Analytics is not merged with other data from Google.

                <strong>Social media presence</strong>

                <ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">
                <li>We maintain profiles or fan pages in social media. When you use and access our profile in the respective network, the respective data protection notices and terms of use of the respective network apply.<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>data categories and description of data processing:</strong> usage data, contact data, content data, inventory data. Furthermore, user data within social networks is usually processed for market research and advertising purposes. Thus, for example, user profiles can be created on the basis of usage behaviour and the resulting interests of the users. The user profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the users' computers, in which the usage behaviour and interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data may also be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them). For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the possibilities of objection (opt-out), we refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective networks. Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we point out that these can be most effectively asserted with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users in each case and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information. Should you nevertheless require assistance, you can contact us.<br><br /></li>
                <li><strong>purpose of the processing:</strong> Communication with the users connected and registered on the social networks; information and advertising for our products, offers and services; outward presentation and image cultivation; evaluation and analysis of the users and contents of our presence in the social media.<br /><br /></li>
                <The legal basis for the processing of personal data is our legitimate interest in the above-mentioned purposes in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) DS-GVO. Insofar as you have given your consent to us or the person responsible for the social network to process your personal data, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) in conjunction with Art. 7 DS-GVO.<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>data transmission/recipient category:</strong> social network.
