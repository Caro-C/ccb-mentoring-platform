                I promised you to explain more detailed about how all the code
                becomes a website in the end. Code alone is just text. And also
                a pretty illegible kind of text.
                Something has to bring the code to life now. Something needs to make the beautiful image
                out of it that you've imagined and programmed.

              <div class="single-post-text">

                <h2 class="h2-for-post">Get the code into your browser</h2>

                I love that moment when I can suddenly see what I have written as code in a real browser.
                My website doesn't even have to be online for that. I can simply drag my code-files into my browser to view the page.
                So I can look at the whole thing before I publish it. This is quite handy because I'm rarely satisfied with the result on the first try.<br><br>

                But let's assume that my blog is online and you type 'www.coffeecodebreak.de' in your browser. If you read my article
                <a href="../reads-en/get-a-website-to-the-internet.html" class="blog-links">How to get a website on the internet</a>
                you might remember that my code-files (and everything else that goes with it) are based on a web server. Your browser sends a request to this web server. The server in turn replies by sending your browser everything it needs to display my web page. This is not only code, but also, for example, image files for the pictures you can see. <br><br>

                Just because the whole thing has now arrived in your browser, it does not look nice yet. Actually it does not look like anything at all. Something has to happen now so that you can see my website with all its blog posts, images and colors. And this is done by a program that is included in your browser. This program is called Rendering Engine. 'Rendering' means nothing else than turning my HTML and CSS code into a visual representation.<br><br>

                <h2 class="h2-for-post">How the rendering engine 'translates' the code</h2>
                <h4>The structure of my HTML code</h4>

                To understand about rendering, we have to look at my HTML document again.<br>
                My HTML code has a certain structure. This structure consists of all elements that together form the content of my page. They are nested, arranged next to each other or one after the other.<br><br>

                As is very common in IT, the whole thing can be represented as a classic tree structure with parent nodes and child nodes. For example, my sidebar is a parent node that has different child nodes: 'About Me', my profile picture, my contact box, etc. Again, the sidebar itself has a parent node (the element containing my page content) and a sibling node (the element containing the blog posts).
                My complete HTML code can be displayed in a tree structure. You can imagine this tree like this:<br><br>

                <div class="single-post-sub-image">
                  <img src="../../assets/dom-tree.jpg" alt="Document Object Model tress structure">
                </div><br>

                Furthermore, my HTML elements each have a certain 'character'. For example, some I have defined as headlines, some as paragraphs and some as images.
                How exactly this works with HTML I will explain in another post.<br>

                <h4>The role of CSS</h4>
                If I hadn't written additional CSS code, my website would be a pretty ugly list of text and images after rendering. It would look something like this:<br><br>

                <div class="single-post-sub-image">
                  <img src="../../assets/website-ohne-css.PNG" alt="Redered website without CSS">
                </div><br>

                Fortunately, the web server also sent my CSS code to your browser. I gave my elements in HTML certain 'names' for identification (technically speaking, I gave them classes and IDs). Using these names I can pick out an HTML element in CSS and design it. My LinkedIn symbol is only shown in the upper right corner because I defined in CSS that it should be there. And because you are reading a post of the category TECH-READS, TECH-READS is colored gold at the top. I have defined this with CSS as well.<br>

                <h4>The job of the Rendering Engine</h4>
                Back to the rendering engine. The rendering engine recognizes the tree structure of my HTML code. Actually, it even breaks it down into its individual elements and rebuilds the tree itself.
                It recognizes what kind of element it is - a headline, a link, an image etc. And since I have defined for the elements in my CSS code how they should look like and where they should be arranged, the rendering engine knows this information too. Once it has built the tree structure, it walks through it schematically, calculating element by element where and how exactly it should appear on your screen. And so it helps the browser to display my code as a beautiful website.<br><br>

                That way, my code becomes exactly the blog you are reading right now. So you see the visualization of what I have thought up and described in code. A compilation of different elements that I have arranged, designed and filled with content according to my ideas. Pretty fascinating, right? So programming a frontend is a bit like painting, but with text! <br><br>

                Maybe you noticed that I was only talking about HTML and CSS. In my other posts I had mentioned JavaScript as another language. With JavaScript I can make my page interactive. But this only comes into play when my page is already displayed.<br><br>

                I hope you enjoyed the article and that you learned something new!<br><br>

                See you soon!<br><br>
