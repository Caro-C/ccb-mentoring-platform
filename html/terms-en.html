                Please read the following terms and conditions, which apply to every user of the coffeecodebreak.de website. By using this website, you agree to these terms and conditions. The owner of the website reserves the right to change, delete or supplement the information on this website at any time and without prior notice.<br><br>

                <strong>1. Scope</strong><br><br>
                The following terms and conditions apply to the use of the website coffeecodebreak.de and related services. By agreeing to them, you guarantee that you will not violate the terms and conditions.
                Subject of coffeecodebreak.de is the following:<br><br>
                The website coffeecodebreak.de introduces mentors with whom you can book free mentoring sessions. The mentors are women who work in the tech sector and who volunteer to offer mentoring sessions at times of their choice.<br><br>

                <strong>2. Services</strong><br><br>
                The use of mentoring sessions via coffeecodebreak.de is free of charge. The offer supports women in finding easy access to other women in the tech sector and in discussing professional topics with them.
                The user (the mentee) is free to book mentoring sessions with different mentors. Mentees can also join the CoffeeCodeBreak network on LinkedIn in order to network with other women in the tech sector, exchange professional and topic-related content and take advantage of the offers of third parties.
                The owner of the website can change, expand, restrict or discontinue the services offered at any time.<br><br>

                <strong>3. Use of the services</strong><br><br>
                To become a mentee, the user books a mentoring session with a mentor on coffeecodebreak.de.
                To do so, the user first agrees to the terms and conditions. Afterwards, the user selects a time slot in the mentor's calendar and books the session.
                Mentee and mentor agree on how the mentoring session will take place. For this purpose, either online meetings or personal meetings are possible.<br><br>

                <strong>4. Right of withdrawal</strong><br><br>
                Both mentees and mentors can cancel booked mentoring sessions at any time or not appear at the booked date.
                Mentees and mentors have no legal claim to the actual occurrence of booked mentoring sessions.<br><br>
                Mentors can withdraw their participation in the services offered by coffeecodebreak.de at any time and without giving reasons. To do so, please contact info@coffeecodebreak.com. Your profile with all your personal data and information will be removed from the website as soon as possible.<br><br>

                <strong>5. Duration of use of the services</strong><br><br>
                There is no time limit on the use of the services that are currently offered.
                In addition, the duration of a mentoring session can be determined individually by each mentor in consultation with the mentee.
                A mentoring session can be terminated by either party at any time and without giving reasons.<br><br>

                <strong>6. Privacy</strong><br><br>
                In order to be able to participate in the service program as a mentor, the user sends her data and information, which should be displayed on coffeecodebreak.de, to info@coffeecodebreak.com.
                By sending their data and information, each mentor expressly agrees to their publication on coffeecodebreak.de.<br><br>
                Mentees and mentors receive information and data on other mentees and mentors as part of the mentoring offer. The passing on of this data and information to third parties or their commercial use is prohibited unless the person entitled has given his or her consent.
                In addition, all users of this website are prohibited from using the personal data and information provided by the mentors for commercial purposes. In case of violations coffeecodebreak.de reserves the right to take legal action.
                Further information about data protection can be found in the privacy policy of this website.<br><br>

                <strong>7. Rights of use of data and information</strong><br><br>
                If a user transmits her data and information in order to be displayed as a mentor on coffeecodebreak, she grants the owner of coffeecodebreak.de a transferable, unlimited and irrevocable right of use of this content, also in edited form or excerpts.<br><br>
                If a mentor or mentee creates a contribution as part of coffeecodebreak.de's mentoring offer, which they make available for publication on the website or in other electronic, e.g. social media, they also grant a transferable, unlimited and irrevocable right of use of this content. Furthermore the creator of this content is responsible for ensuring that it has the necessary rights to the content.<br><br>

                <strong>8. Availability of the website and services</strong><br><br>
                The website coffeecodebreak.de has an availability of 24 hours a day. However, it may happen that there are interruptions in availability, for example for technical reasons.
                In particular, there is no claim to the availability of the services at any time. It can happen that no mentoring sessions can be booked. If an offered service is not available, the owner of coffeecodebreak.de is not liable for it.<br><br>

                <strong>9. Responsibility and liability</strong><br><br>
                The owner of coffeecodebreak.de is not liable for content provided by mentees, mentors or third parties in the context of using the services.
